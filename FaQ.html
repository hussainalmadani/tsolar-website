                    <h3>What services do you offer?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>We provide full solar power systems — from design and installation to testing and activation. We handle everything, including panels, inverters, batteries, wiring, and support structures.</p>
            </div>

                    <h3>Do you offer a warranty?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Yes, we offer a strong warranty on all parts and services. Our systems typically include:<br>
• 30 years on solar panels<br>
• 15 years on inverters and batteries</p>

                    <h3>How long does installation take?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>For most homes or small businesses, installation takes 1-3 days. Larger projects may take longer, depending on size and complexity.</p>

                    <h3>Do I need batteries with my system?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Not always. If you want backup power during outages or at night, batteries are a great option. We can install battery storage systems tailored to your needs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">

                    <h3>How much will it cost?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Cost depends on the size of the system. We offer free on-site assessments to give you a custom quote based on your energy use and budget.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-row">
                    <span class="faq-number">6</span>
                    <h3>What is the system size that I need?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>That depends on your average monthly electricity usage and your goals (full backup vs. partial). We’ll do a free on-site assessment to calculate the exact size and recommend the best system for your needs. In addition, our team can assess your place on-site to give a more accurate answer.</p>

                    <h3>Can I power my whole home or business with solar?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Yes, we can design systems large enough to cover 100% of your electricity needs. We’ll calculate your average usage and build a system that fits.</p>
            </div>

                    <h3>What happens during a power outage?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>With batteries, your system will automatically switch to backup mode. Without batteries, grid-tied systems shut off for safety during outages.</p>
            </div>

                    <h3>How much money will I save with solar?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Savings depend on your energy usage, local rates, and system size. Most customers see significant reductions in their electricity bills. It depends on your current bill and system size, but most clients make up for what they would spend on generators within 1-2 years.</p>

                    <h3>How long do solar panels last?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Most panels last 30+ years, with very little drop in performance. Our warranty covers that lifespan.</p>

                    <h3>Do I need to clean or maintain my panels?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Yes — in Iraq, dusty environment, regular cleaning is important to keep your panels working at full efficiency. That’s why we offer a monthly maintenance service that includes panel cleaning and battery health checks, so your system stays in top shape year-round.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Yes. Solar still generates electricity on cloudy days, just at reduced output. Our systems are designed to perform year-round.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Absolutely. We design systems with future upgrades in mind — you can add more panels, batteries, or even EV chargers later.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Absolutely. Iraq has excellent sun exposure, rising electricity costs, and frequent power cuts — solar gives you independence, savings, and reliability.</p>
